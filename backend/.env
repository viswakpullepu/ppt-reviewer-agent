# IMPORTANT: How to Keep Your API Key Safe
# $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
#
# NEVER commit this .env file to GitHub!
# The .env file is in .gitignore to protect your secrets.
#
# WHERE TO KEEP YOUR API KEY:
# 1. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
#    - Clone repo locally: git clone https://github.com/viswakpullepu/ppt-reviewer-agent.git
#    - Edit backend/.env (on your local machine ONLY, not on GitHub)
#    - Replace sk-proj-YOUR-ACTUAL-API-KEY-HERE with your real OpenAI API key
#    - This file will NOT be uploaded to GitHub (protected by .gitignore)
#
# 2. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (BEST PRACTICE):
#    - Use environment variables on your server/cloud platform
#    - Heroku: Set via heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
#    - AWS: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store
#    - Docker: Pass via docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
#    - Docker Compose: Use .env file locally, NOT in repository
#
# 3. GET YOUR API KEY:
#    - Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
#    - Sign up for OpenAI (includes free credits)
#    - Create a new API key
#    - Copy it and paste it in the OPENAI_API_KEY line below
#
# 4. SECURITY CHECKLIST:
#    ✓ Never share your API key
#    ✓ Never paste it in chat, emails, or public sites
#    ✓ Regenerate key if accidentally exposed
#    ✓ Use different keys for dev/production
#    ✓ Always keep .env in .gitignore
